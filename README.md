# ZTD - CLI Task Manager

![ZTD CLI Task Manager Logo](./images/ZTD%20Task%20Manager%20Logo%20Design.png)

ZTD is a command-line to-do list manager based on the **Zen To Done (ZTD)** methodology developed by **Leo Babauta**.  
This tool is designed for **productivity** and **simplicity**, with support for priorities, categories, recurring tasks, and more.

---

## Features

The app runs in the Command Line Interface (CLI) and has the following features:

- Add tasks with categories (`@category`), priorities (`!urgent`), and recurrence (`~daily`)
- View/sort tasks by category
- Mark tasks as done
- Delete single or multiple tasks
- Set or update priorities, categories, recurrence
- Save/load tasks from JSON file
- Natural language date parsing for scheduling
- For recurring tasks, automatically re-adds recurring tasks (daily/weekly/monthly) on the appropriate date
- When a new task is added, blank `[category]` and `(-)` priority spaces are retained to prompt the user to manually add them
