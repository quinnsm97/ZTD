## Usage

To run the app for the first time:

```bash
python 'ZTD_APP_Code.py'
```
The program will display a menu with various task management options. You can navigate by entering the corresponding command.

**Example commands:**

```bash
add email boss @work !urgent ~daily
list
done 2
category 1 2 work
recur 1 daily
priority 1 urgent
delete 1,2
```

Commands are designed to be shorthand for speed and efficiency.  
They must be typed accurately to work correctly.
